## Introduction
* The illegal logging industry extracts about 30 million m³ of wood from European forests every year which creates a major threat to forest ecosystems.
* This research describes the development and mathematical modeling of a small autonomous system which detects and precisely identifies dangerous acoustic events including chainsaw and gunshot noises in distant forested regions.
* The system combines digital signal processing with low-power hardware and geospatial triangulation to provide immediate alerts to a central monitoring station.
